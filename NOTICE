This project includes third-party code from esp-wifi-sys written primarily by the ESP-RS team.

However, it depends on proprietary static libraries (placed in the `libs` directory) from ESP8266_RTOS_SDK.
Due to GPL-2.0 requirements, we cannot distribute compiled binaries including these proprietary components.
Users must obtain the proprietary libraries separately and compile the project themselves.
